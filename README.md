# Dynamic Cards

## Description
- Create an HTML page that contains a text area and a button labeled Create.
- When the user enters in text into the text area and then clicks the create button, create a new card element in the DOM. You decide the height/width of the card.
- When the user clicks the Delete button, the containing card, and no other cards, should then be removed from the DOM. Not just made invisible, actually removed from the DOM.

## How to run application
In your terminal run:
```
http-server -p 9999
```
then navigate to http://localhost:9999 in your browser.
